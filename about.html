                        I learned everything related to technology, cameras, computers and other things exclusively by
                        myself (from Youtube and other sites).<br>
                        I deleted facebook. I only use viber and whatsapp (instagram only for projects). <br>
                        I like calisthenics, parkour and tricking. <br>
                        I have no problem doing a project or work for free if I know that it has a special purpose, i.e.
                        that its value will be greater than the effort invested. <br>
                        I hate doing things that I don't think are useful or interesting (sometimes even though they are
                        paid).<br>
                        Languages and social interactions are my weak point. That's why I joined <a
