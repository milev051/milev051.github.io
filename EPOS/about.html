        <p class="title">Who was Ed Gein?</p>
        <p>
          <b>Ed Gein</b> grew up in a repressive household dominated by a
          controlling mother. Following her death in 1945, his mental health
          disintegrated. After Gein was apprehended as a suspect in a 1957
          murder, the investigation of his home yielded a highly disturbed man
          who kept human organs and fashioned clothing and accessories out of
          body parts. He spent the rest of his life institutionalized, his story
          fueling the inspiration of such famous movie characters as
          <b>Norman Bates</b> (<italic>Psycho</italic>), <b>Buffalo Bill</b> (<italic>The Silence of the Lambs</italic>) 
          and <b>Leatherface</b> (<italic>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</italic>).

        <p class="title">Repressive Upbringing</p>
        <p>
          <b>Edward Theodore Gein</b> was born on August 27, 1906, in La Crosse,
          Wisconsin. The son of <b>George</b>, a timid alcoholic father, and
          <b>Augusta</b>, a fanatically religious mother, Gein grew up alongside
          his older brother, <b>Henry</b>, in a household ruled by his mother's
          puritanical preachings about the sins of lust and carnal desire.
          Around 1915, Augusta moved the family to a farm outside Plainfield,
          Wisconsin. Gein rarely left the farm, except for attending school.
          After George died in 1940, Gein and Henry began working more odd jobs
          to support the family. In 1944, the brothers were burning brush on the
          property, when the fire raged out of control. Henry was found dead,
          and although it was initially believed to be the result of the fire,
          the circumstances surrounding his death, as well as Gein's later
          activities, led to conjecture that the younger brother was
          responsible.

        <p class="title">The Monster Comes Out</p>
        <p>
          Obsessively <b>devoted to his mother</b>, Gein never left home or
          dated women. However, after she died in late 1945, he became
          increasingly deranged. Now living alone, he left her room neat and
          untouched, while the rest of the home fell into squalor, and he
          developed an interest in anatomy books. Gein managed to support
          himself as a handyman and despite his odd behavior as a babysitter.
          Meanwhile, a few residents from the general area had mysteriously
          disappeared over the years. Among them was <b>Mary Hogan</b>, who ran
          a tavern in nearby Pine Grove that Gein regularly frequented.

        <p class="title">Murder of Bernice Worden</p>
        <p>
          On November 16, 1957, <b>Bernice Worden</b> was reported missing from
          her hardware store in Plainfield, with the cash register also gone and
          a trail of blood leading out the back. Her son Frank, a deputy
          sheriff, was suspicious of Gein, and the reclusive man was soon
          apprehended at a neighbor's house. The authorities sent to Gein's home
          that night were greeted by the gruesome sight of Worden's headless,
          gutted body hanging from the ceiling. Further investigation yielded
          more shocking discoveries, including organs in jars and skulls used as
          soup bowls. Under questioning, Gein confessed to killing
          <b>Worden</b> and <b>Hogan</b>, three years earlier. Additionally, he
          admitted to digging up numerous corpses for cutting off body parts,
          practicing necrophilia and fashioning masks and suits out of skin to
          wear around the home. With that sort of evidence, authorities
          attempted to connect him to other murders and disappearances from
          recent years but were unable to draw any definitive conclusions.
          Gein's lawyer, William Belter, entered a plea of not guilty by reason
          of insanity, and in January 1958, Gein was found unfit to stand trial.
          He was committed to Central State Hospital, where he variously worked
          as a mason, carpenter's assistant and medical center aide.

        <p class="title">Trial and Death</p>
        <p>
          In early 1968, <b>Gein</b> was determined fit
          <b>to finally stand trial</b>. That November, he was found guilty of
          the murder of Worden. However, he was also found insane at the time of
          the murder, and as such he was recommitted to Central State Hospital.
          Save for his attempt to petition for a release in 1974, which was
          rejected, the mild-mannered Gein made virtually no news while
          institutionalized. Later that decade, his health failing, he was
          transferred to the Mendota Mental Health Institute, where
          <b>he died of cancer and respiratory illnesses</b> on July 26, 1984.
